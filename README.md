# SCSNL_ASD_Hetero
for the asd heterogeneity project
There are three files in this folder to run the data analysis ##this is my first trial of jupyter notebook so everything can be improved later
The "ASD_Hetero.ipynb" has all the scripts to produce figures and tables used for the analysis
The ASD_heterogeneity_SEM.csv is the data for the analysis used in the .ipynb file ##all the subject info has been removed; the ID was pseudo created)
The "R_functions_forJupyter.R" contains self-written functions in R to create tables and graphs easier ##This file can be put at a centralized location and retrieved for each specific project... need to figure this out later

All the packages needed to run the R script are listed at the top of the script in ".ipynb". Please have all the packages installed first (using install.packages("XX"), with XX being the name of the packages) in order to run the script.

Any questions can be sent to lchen32@stanford.edu
